            family, is a genius who was allowed to enroll in the Sarean University
            of Magic along with his twin sister, Alise, at the young age of eleven.
            He went on to earn a Bachelor's Degree in a number of fields,
            including Magick and Etherology. After graduation, with the opportunity
            to become an adult at the age of 16, he crossed the sea to Eorzea despite
            his father's objections. All of this was to carry on the legacy of his grandfather,
            Luisova. He joined the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. However, during his journey
            with the Warriors of Light in the Dragon Poetry War, he gained experience
            in meeting a wide variety of people, and he grew to be able to stand on his own.</p>

        <p class="introduction_block_right">A young girl affiliated with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.
            Although she and her twin brother Alphinaud are equallyknown as prodigies,
            the two are completely opposite. The older brother
            always likes to give long speeches and also likes to study politics.
            Her sister, however, is very outspoken and will work hard to train
            herself to save as many people as possible, even if she gets hurt doing so.

            After being summoned to the First World by the Crystal Exarch, Alisaie decided to start investigating the source of
            the flood of light.

            its guardian. He saw the occurrence of the Eighth Spiritual Plague,
            in which the Warriors of Light and Dawn and others died, and the
            unending catastrophe that followed. According to the plan proposed
            by Sid, Guru Raha sent himself and the Crystal Tower to the First
            World after the Flood of Light in order to stop the source of
            the Eighth Spiritual Plague, the Flood of Light, and, as the
            "Crystal Exarch," built the Crystal Capital around the Crystal
            Tower as a shelter for the people and a base of resistance.

            <p>Ala Mhigo is at last free from imperial rule, but that liberty may
                prove fleeting as the Empire moves to both reclaim this bloodied
                nation and subjugate all of Eorzea.In their hour of need, however,
                they cannot turn to the Warrior of Light. Nor to the Scions, who
                yet slumber, their souls adrift. 
                <br><br>
                The realm is left to struggle without its saviors. Here
                a new adventure begins in a world where light ushers all unto
                oblivion. But hope is not yet lost, for where there is light there is shadow.
                <br><br>
                The Crystal Exarch is the highesr leader, simtaneously the founder,
                to the Crystal City's autonomous organization, the Settlement, and
                leads the city's residents in their ongoing struggle. The title 
                Crystal Exarch comes from the Crystal Tower and his crystallized body.</p>

            <p>The Flood of Light rendered the vast majority of the First devoid
                of life, with Norvrandt remaining as the last bastion. Being a
                reflection of the Source, its climates and environs resemble
                those of Eorzea, though the cultures of its diverse range of
                inhabitants have taken an entirely different course over its troubled history.</p>
